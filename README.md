## About

`reana-env-aliphysics` provides a container image with encapsulated runtime
execution environment for [AliPhysics](https://github.com/alisw/AliPhysics)
based ALICE data analyses. The container image includes all the necessary
dependencies and does not have any external requirements (such as CVMFS).

`reana-env-aliphysics` was developed for use in the
[REANA](http://reana.readthedocs.io/) reusable research data analysis platform.

## Usage

You can use `reana-env-aliphysics` as a base image for containerising your own
AliPhysics-based research data analyses. You can simply start your `Dockerfile`
from this base image and add your custom code on top, or you can use the image
"as is" and mount your runtime code to the running container. Some concrete
usage examples will be provided later on.

## Development

You can build an AliPhysics image corresponding to a particular AliPhysics
version selected from the [list of published Alice
packages](http://alimonitor.cern.ch/packages/?packagename=AliPhysics) by setting
up the `ALIPHYSICS_VERSION` environment variable:

```console
$ export ALIPHYSICS_VERSION=vAN-20170521-1
$ make build
```

You can test the built container image briefly:

```console
$ make test
```

If you would like to try it locally, you can run:

```console
$ docker run -i -t --rm -v $HOME/foo:/foo docker.io/reanahub/reana-env-aliphysics:vAN-20170521-1 /bin/bash
```

which will drop you to a shell with the appropriate AliPhysics environment
already set. Everything you write in `/foo` inside the container will be
available outside the container under `~/foo`.

If all the tests are successful, you can publish the newly created AliPhysics
image on Docker Hub:

```console
$ make push
```
